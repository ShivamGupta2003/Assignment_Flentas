This architecture is designed to support a highly scalable web application capable of handling 10,000+ concurrent users. User requests flow through Route 53, CloudFront, and AWS WAF for DNS routing, caching, and security filtering. The Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes traffic across an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances in private subnets to ensure high availability and elasticity. A Bastion Host in the public subnet enables secure SSH access, while a NAT Gateway provides outbound internet access for private EC2s. The application uses Aurora/RDS for a scalable relational database and Redis/ElastiCache for low-latency caching. API Gateway and Lambda functions support serverless backend components where needed. Logging and metrics from all resources are collected in CloudWatch for observability. Security is enforced using Security Groups, NACLs, and WAF to protect all network layers.
