For this project, I designed a basic AWS network architecture that includes a VPC with both public and private subnets, along with internet access for public resources and controlled outbound access for private resources.
VPC Design
I created one VPC with the CIDR range 10.0.0.0/16.
This range allows up to 65,536 IP addresses and provides enough room to divide into multiple subnets.
Subnet Design
I created 4 subnets — two public and two private — spread across two Availability Zones for high availability.
Public Subnets
These subnets are connected to the Internet Gateway (IGW) through the public route table.
EC2 instances launched here get direct internet access (via an IGW).
Used for resources like ALBs, Bastion hosts, etc.
Private Subnets
These subnets do not have IGW access.
Their route table sends outbound traffic to a NAT Gateway, which allows:
Private instances to download OS updates/packages.
Prevents the internet from directly initiating a connection to them.
Routing Setup
Public Route Table
Has route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
Private Route Table
Has route: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
This ensures the correct separation of public and private networks.
NAT Gateway
Created in Public Subnet 1 with an Elastic IP.
Allows outbound-only internet access for Private Subnets.

4. CIDR Ranges Used & Justification
VPC CIDR
10.0.0.0/16
Large enough for future scaling.
Easy to divide into /24 subnets.
Public Subnet 1
10.0.1.0/24
Public Subnet 2
10.0.2.0/24
Private Subnet 1
10.0.3.0/24
Private Subnet 2
10.0.4.0/24
