This Terraform configuration deploys a complete AWS infrastructure consisting of a VPC with both public and private subnets, an Internet Gateway, routing for public subnets, security groups, an Application Load Balancer, a Target Group, a Launch Template, and an Auto Scaling Group. The VPC uses the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 and contains two public subnets for the load balancer and two private subnets where EC2 instances run securely without direct internet exposure. The public subnets are connected to an Internet Gateway through a route table that allows outbound traffic. Security groups are configured so the ALB accepts HTTP traffic from anywhere, while EC2 instances only accept traffic forwarded by the ALB, ensuring strong network isolation. The Launch Template defines EC2 configuration using an Amazon Linux 2 AMI, installs and starts Apache through user data, and sets up a simple webpage. The Application Load Balancer, deployed across public subnets, forwards incoming HTTP requests to the Target Group, which performs health checks on EC2 instances. The Auto Scaling Group launches EC2 instances in private subnets, attaches them to the Target Group, and maintains the desired capacity to ensure high availability. This architecture provides a secure, scalable, and highly available environment for running a web application using AWS best practices and Infrastructure as Code.
