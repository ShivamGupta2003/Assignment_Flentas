To complete the Billing and Free Tier Cost Monitoring task, I first logged into my AWS Management Console and navigated to the Billing Dashboard. From there, I enabled Billing Alerts so that AWS CloudWatch could monitor my spending. After enabling this option, I opened CloudWatch, went to the Alarms section, and created a new Billing Alarm. I set the threshold to ₹100, chose "Estimated Charges" as the metric, selected "Greater than or equal to" as the condition, and configured the notification through my email using SNS. Once the alarm was created, I verified that it was active and ready to send alerts whenever my estimated costs crossed ₹100.

Next, I enabled Free Tier Usage Alerts by going back to the Billing Dashboard and opening the Free Tier Alerts section. I turned on the option to receive notifications when my usage approached or exceeded Free Tier limits. This helps ensure that any unexpected usage is detected early, preventing unwanted bills.

Overall, the workflow involved accessing the billing settings, activating alerts, creating a budget threshold, and enabling notifications. This setup ensures that I can closely monitor my AWS costs and avoid surprises.
